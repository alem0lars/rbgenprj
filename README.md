# RBGenPrj

Ruby project generator, with different flavours, empowered by Thor.

## Motivation

There are many good ruby project generators, with a lot of stuff...

Use them if you need a complex solution, but I just need a *KISS solution to bootstrap my ruby projects in less than 10 seconds*..

## Usage

```ShellSession
$ ./rbgenprj
```

## Dependencies:

* Ruby
* The `thor` gem.
